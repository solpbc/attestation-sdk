# NVIDIA Attestation SDK (NVAT)

**sol pbc modified fork.** This repository contains sol pbc's changes to [NVIDIA's Attestation SDK](https://github.com/NVIDIA/attestation-sdk). The [modified upstream file record](sol/notes/modified-upstream-files.md) identifies the files changed for each published `sol.1`–`sol.4` revision. Current changed upstream files carry in-file change notices, and NVIDIA's existing notices remain in place.

NVAT (**NV**IDIA **At**testation SDK)
is an open-source C++ SDK that provides resources for implementing and
validating Trusted Computing Solutions on NVIDIA hardware.
It focuses on attestation, a crucial aspect of ensuring the integrity and 
security of confidential computing environments.

The core SDK is written in C++. It can be used via a C API, a CLI (nvattest), or Rust bindings.

## Project Status

This project is the successor of the Python-based guest tools in [nvTrust](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvtrust).
NVAT provides utilities suitable for a broader range of environments and use-cases.

## Components

NVAT provides three components for different use cases:

- **CLI (`nvattest`)**: For quick testing, scripts, and getting started. [Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/attestation/nv-attestation-sdk-cpp/latest/sdk-cli/introduction.html)
- **C API**: For integrating attestation into C/C++ applications. [Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/attestation/nv-attestation-sdk-cpp/latest/sdk-c/introduction.html)
- **Rust bindings**: For integrating attestation into Rust applications. [Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/attestation/nv-attestation-sdk-cpp/latest/sdk-rust/introduction.html)

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

**For Confidential Computing (CC) attestation:**
- A supported NVIDIA GPU connected to a CVM running Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04. See [NVIDIA Trusted Computing Solutions](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvtrust/) for deployment guides covering Intel TDX and AMD SNP.

**For general GPU attestation (non-CC):**
- A supported NVIDIA GPU
- Supported architectures: x86-64, aarch64
- Supported operating systems: Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04, and others (see [downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvat-downloads) for full list)

### Installation

1. Install the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML). See [Driver Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/driver-installation-guide/index.html#ubuntu-installation-common).

2. Install `nvattest`. Navigate to [NVIDIA Attestation SDK Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvat-downloads) and select your architecture and operating system.

For a source install, refer to the [CLI Introduction](https://docs.nvidia.com/attestation/nv-attestation-sdk-cpp/latest/overview.html).

**Note:** For Confidential Computing attestation, these steps must be performed in a CVM connected to an NVIDIA GPU. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above.

### Attestation

Attest the GPU(s) attached to your CVM with the following command:

```shell
nvattest attest --device gpu --verifier local
```

Use `--help` to view all the options associated with the attest subcommand:

```shell
nvattest attest --help
```

### Using the C API

To get started with the C API, refer to the documentation in the
[SDK introduction](https://docs.nvidia.com/attestation/nv-attestation-sdk-cpp/latest/sdk-c/introduction.html).
